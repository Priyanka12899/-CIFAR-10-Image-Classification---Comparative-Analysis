# -CIFAR-10-Image-Classification---Comparative-Analysis

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used benchmark in the field of computer vision, consisting of 60,000 labeled images categorised into 10 different classes (Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck). It serves as a challenging task for image classification algorithms, requiring robust and accurate models. In this project, we aim to compare the performance of traditional classifiers and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the CIFAR-10 dataset, with the objective of understanding the strengths and limitations of each approach.

In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized the field of computer vision, showcasing remarkable capabilities in image classification tasks. This project explores the application of transfer learning by leveraging pre-trained CNN models as backbones to enhance the performance of image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a widely recognized benchmark dataset, comprising 60,000 32x32 color images across ten different classes, presenting a challenging environment for image recognition.

This project that aims to assess the performance of Deep learning model with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 labeled images categorised into 10 different classes, making it a challenging benchmark for image classification tasks. The project's objective is to evaluate and analyze the strengths and limitations of traditional classifiers and CNNs in handling image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Traditional classifiers rely on handcrafted features and predefined classification rules, while CNNs can automatically learn and extract relevant features from raw pixel data.

By conducting a this analysis, we will assess the classification accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness of CNN approach. The project aims to provide insights into which method is better suited for image classification tasks on the CIFAR-10 dataset, considering factors such as accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability to varying dataset characteristics. This project can also include using other popular ConvNets as backbones with modified output layers. The outcomes of this study will contribute to the understanding significance of CNNs in image classification. Ultimately, this project will provide valuable insights into the potential benefits and limitations of CNNs for image classification tasks on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
