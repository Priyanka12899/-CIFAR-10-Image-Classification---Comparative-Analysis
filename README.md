# -CIFAR-10-Image-Classification---Comparative-Analysis

a project that aims to assess the performance of Deep learning model with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 labeled images categorised into 10 different classes, making it a challenging benchmark for image classification tasks. The project's objective is to evaluate and analyze the strengths and limitations of traditional classifiers and CNNs in handling image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Traditional classifiers rely on handcrafted features and predefined classification rules, while CNNs can automatically learn and extract relevant features from raw pixel data.

By conducting a this analysis, we will assess the classification accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness of CNN approach. The project aims to provide insights into which method is better suited for image classification tasks on the CIFAR-10 dataset, considering factors such as accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability to varying dataset characteristics. This project can also include using other popular ConvNets as backbones with modified output layers. The outcomes of this study will contribute to the understanding significance of CNNs in image classification. Ultimately, this project will provide valuable insights into the potential benefits and limitations of CNNs for image classification tasks on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
